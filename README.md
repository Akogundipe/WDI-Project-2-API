#ICAO information
My React app will be informational app on Airport Suitability using ICAO API data. I plan to make stoplight charts accessing aircraft viability of airfields. Information such as whether they have VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) or Instrument Landing System (ILS) which help with landing larger aircraft. Red for unfavorable and unknown conditions, green for favorable conditions.

#An explanation of the major problems you plan to face while implementing this app.
Limit of 100 api calls per month for the API. Lot of data on page

#An explanation of how you foresee yourself solving the aforementioned problems.
I can find a way to sort airfields by capabilities

#A section clearly defining MVP and POST MVP.
